# messenger-stats
A bunch of scripts calculating stats of your messenger convos  

**conversationStarter.py**  
This script counts how many times a chosen person has started a Messenger conversation with you, and how many times you were the one texting first.

**messageStat.py**  
This script counts all messages and tells you how many msgs were sent by you and how many messages the other person sent to you.

Both scripts give results as a standart output and a pie chart
